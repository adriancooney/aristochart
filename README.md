# Aristochart
### Sophisticated and simplified static Javascript 2D line charts
### [http://adriancooney.github.com/aristochart](http://dunxrion.github.com/aristochart)
Every find yourself looking for a chart library that isn't so damn huge and doesn't have any dependencies? I did too and couldn't find any so I decided to create my own. Aristochart is small but it's robust and made to be hacked. The main focus was customization so the library is incredibly extensible.

## Features
* Highly customizable, extensible and flexible.
* Multiple graph ability.
* Automatic data scaling.
* Custom labelling.
* Retina scaling.

## Usage
Aristochart has a simple enough interface. Plug in the canvas element (or placeholder) along with some data and you're good to go.

	new Aristochart(document.body, {
		data: {
			x: 10,
			y: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
			y1: [10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1],
			y2: [4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
		}
	});
